# Build [minica](https://github.com/jsha/minica) for OS X using Docker

Assuming you have Docker installed:

    git clone https://github.com/leukeleu/minica-osx-docker.git
    cd minica-osx-docker
    ./build.sh

Once this is done you should have an executable `minica` file in your current
directory:

    file minica
    minica: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
